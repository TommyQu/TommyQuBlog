						<p>My name is Haotian Qu, you can call me Tommy. Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer, at Ace Info Solutions, Inc. in 
						Reston, Virginia. It is happy to work as what I like, programming.
					<b>Web and Mobile development</b> are my strongest areas.</p>
			<p>I have been studying programming for 5 years. I learned a lot of
					programming skills during the past years such as Java, Android, AngularJS, Ionic, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP.
					<b>Java, Android and AngularJS</b> are my favorite programming languages. Although I have more 
					experience in web development, I'm eager to learn more about mobile development.</p>
			<p>Singing is my favorite hobby. When I was in college, I joined our
				college's chorus. I'm the bass minister. Playing computer games is another my favorite hobby.
				I like Warcraft3, Dota, Diablo. Speaking of Warcraft3, I have a deep emotion with this game.
				I have been playing it for about 10 years. On 2012's summer, I participated in WCG in Nanjing, China. However,
				I lost in the first round :(</p>
			<p>Here is one of my match I found on the YouTube. The blue Human with ID: SFC.sky8_XimiLu is me.
				However, Fzu_Galaxy is my commonly used Id.</p>
